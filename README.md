I realized my interview chops weren't up to snuff after 10 rejection letters and another 5 or so botched interview tests. I decided to study and implement some common algorithms and data structures in Python, without using anything beyond the standard library. The idea is to better understand the barebones of these structures, in order to better prepare myself for further interviews.

I know libraries exist for these things, but that isn't the point. Understanding how they work beneath the surface is important for when it comes to solving more challenging types of questions.

The idea is to:
    1) Better prepare myself for coding interviews
    2) Become more comfortable in Python and OOP, given that 80% of interviews will allow (if not require) either one or both of these things
    3) Learn more about complexity analysis
    4) At the end of the day, spend less time grappling with a problem, and more time understanding it in terms of what data structures would best suit it. The algorithms should fall into place from this point forward.

It's Python, these implementations aren't exactly performant. They should be easy enough to transfer over to C#/Java though, for sake of study or reference
